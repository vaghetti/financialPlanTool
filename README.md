# Financial planning tool

## What

This is a tool for planning personal finances on a long-term basis. It simulates portfolio returns, inflationary increases in things like rent or cost of living, as well as life events like marriages and retirements.

It is hosted on github pages, you can check it out here: https://vaghetti.dev/financialPlanTool/

## Why

I needed to make important life decisions, so I opened excel and started trying to make decisions. It turns out doing this on Excel was not quite pleasant, so I decided to create this little guy instead.

_I still haven't made any decisions, but look how cool these graphs look!_

## TODO
